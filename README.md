# Personal-Portfolio

This is a simple portfolio website that has been created to demonstrate the skills I have learnt in the first week of _nology such as HTML & SCSS, responsive design using flexbox & grid and strict naming conventions with BEM.

In the index.html, HTML semantics have been used to organise the structure of the website. Each section of the website is clearly laid out and corresponds to it own SCSS design file, which can be found in the /includes directory.
